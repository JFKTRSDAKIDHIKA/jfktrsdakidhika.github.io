I am a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Communication Engineering at [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)](https://english.bupt.edu.cn/). I am expected to graduate in July 2027.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Computer Architecture, VLSI, and Electronic Design Automation (EDA).
Currently, I am conducting research on 3D-integrated compute-near-memory architectures. My recent work, FADiff, proposes a fusion-aware differentiable optimization framework for DNN scheduling, which has been submitted to DAC 2026.

On the engineering side, I participated in the "One Student One Chip" (YSYX) program. I designed a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor (RV32E) from scratch using Chisel3 and successfully passed the verification (Stage C).
